# developer-landing-page

I start with the basic structure of the website, showcasing a hero section that introduces "John Doe," a full-stack developer, accompanied by a striking image.
I discuss the various elements included in the landing page, such as a brief introduction of my skills and the services I can provide, like web development and app development. Additionally, I've incorporated sections like "About Me" and "Contact Me," along with a well-designed footer.
